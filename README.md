# homework2

Hello! You actually READ me?!

This homework assignment is for creating a responsive portfolio website! Let's dig in.

Featured on the Navbar, you will find links to my portfolio, information about me and contact information.
I've used my abilities from graphic design to hopefully arrange and style this website the best I can! Color theory is cool!

Text on my page uses containers and rows to fit nicely together. Also a Navbar has been implemented.

That about wraps it up!
