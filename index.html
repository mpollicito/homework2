    <h1>Matthew Pollicito</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Matt Pollicito, I am a very technology-based individual! I was born in Hartford, CT during November
        1989. I have one sibling, an older brother, and ZERO first cousins (wild I know).

        I have always been passionate about creativity and expression of one's self. I enjoyed drawing, painting and
        coloring since a child, these interests are what got me where I am today!
        During my high school years, I began taking graphic design classes to start my journey. I attended Tunxis CC
        part-time after high school to lay groundwork for my future.</p>
